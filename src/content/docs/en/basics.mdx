# Basics before touching any simulation code

This page is for absolute beginners who feel lost when they open code docs.
If you understand the flow and terms below, you can read setup guides with much less friction.

## What this page helps you do

- Understand what a simulation run is actually doing.
- Know which settings matter most for your first run.
- Avoid common beginner mistakes (wrong units, over-large first run, no validation step).

## Core concepts you must know first

- **Hydrodynamics + gravity**: Most galaxy/cosmology runs evolve gas dynamics and gravity together.
- **Discretization**: Continuous equations are represented on mesh cells or particles.
- **Resolution**: Higher detail increases runtime and memory cost rapidly.
- **Timestep control**: Stability limits (for example CFL-like constraints) decide how fast you can advance.
- **Initial conditions**: Bad initial files can make a run fail even when compilation is correct.
- **Boundary conditions**: Periodic vs isolated boundaries can change behavior significantly.
- **Subgrid models**: Star formation/feedback/cooling recipes are approximations below resolved scales.
- **Convergence testing**: A single run is never enough; you need at least a small resolution comparison.

## Beginner checklist before first serious run

1. Write one sentence for your goal. Example: "I want to verify that the solver runs and passes the bundled check script." 
2. Start from the smallest official example, not a full science setup.
3. Confirm output files are being created where you expect.
4. Read runtime logs and look for warnings, not only crashes.
5. Run the provided validation/check script when available.
6. Change one parameter at a time, then rerun.

## How to read code docs efficiently

1. Read **Getting Started / Running** first.
2. Read the example directory you will execute.
3. Read required config/parameter sections only for that example.
4. Read method papers after your first successful run.

This order reduces context overload and helps you build confidence quickly.

## Suggested path in this site

1. Start with [Arepo](/en/codes/arepo/) and complete one validated example run.
2. Use [Compare](/en/compare/) to understand method-family trade-offs.
3. Use [Glossary](/en/glossary/) when terms become unclear.
