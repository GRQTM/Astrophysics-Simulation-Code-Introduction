# Core concepts before touching any codebase

If you understand what is being solved and which numerical trade-offs matter, code documentation becomes easier to read.

## Minimum concept set

- **Hydrodynamics + gravity**: many astrophysical problems require both.
- **Discretization**: continuous equations become cells or particles.
- **Resolution**: more detail costs more memory and runtime.
- **Time integration**: stable timestep control is critical.

## Practical reading order

1. Pick a target problem (galaxy formation, cluster evolution, idealized tests).
2. Compare method families (mesh, AMR, particle-based).
3. Check assumptions (boundary conditions, cooling, feedback models).
