# Compare Simulation Codes

Not sure which code to try first? This table summarizes the key differences so you can make a practical choice.

## Quick Comparison

| Code | Method | Key Strength | Trade-off |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Arepo | Moving-mesh | Precisely tracks gas flow and morphology using a Voronoi mesh that moves with the gas. | Initial configuration can be complex. |
| Enzo | Eulerian AMR | Captures sharp shocks cleanly and refines specific regions on demand. | Less naturally suited for tracking fast-moving gas clumps. |
| Gadget | SPH | Robust, handles voids efficiently, and has the largest user community. | Shock resolution is softer compared to mesh-based codes. |
| Gizmo | Mesh-free (MFM/MFV) | Combines the advantages of SPH and grid methods for high accuracy. | Parameter setup can require careful initial tuning. |
| Ramses | Eulerian AMR | Excellent scaling on large HPC clusters; very fast for big volumes. | Output datasets can become large and require managed storage. |

> **Practical tip:** You don't need to find the "perfect" code on day one. Start with the code your lab already uses, or whichever Quickstart is easiest to set up on your machine.
