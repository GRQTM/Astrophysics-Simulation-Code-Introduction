# Side-by-side code comparison

This matrix is intentionally compact for beginners. Add details only with source-backed claims.

| Code | Method family | Typical strength | Potential caveat |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Arepo | Moving-mesh finite-volume | Fluid interface handling + adaptivity | Broad configuration space |
| Enzo | Eulerian AMR grid | Hierarchical refinement control | Refinement sensitivity |
| Gadget | TreePM + SPH family | Broad historical usage in cosmology | SPH setting dependence |
| Gizmo | Mesh-free finite-mass/volume | Particle adaptivity + modern hydro behavior | Mode and parameter tuning |
