# Glossary

Key terms used throughout this guide. We keep definitions consistent across all code pages so you can switch between them without confusion.

## Conventions

- The **English term** is the primary reference for all definitions.
- Terms like **AMR**, **SPH**, and **Hydrodynamics** carry the same meaning whether you are reading about Arepo or Gadget.

## Terms

- **Hydrodynamics**: The numerical treatment of fluid motion — how gas flows, collides, and forms shocks in a simulation.
- **N-body**: Computing the gravitational interaction among many discrete particles, such as dark matter halos or stellar populations.
- **AMR (Adaptive Mesh Refinement)**: A grid technique that automatically adds finer cells only where needed (e.g., near shocks or dense regions), saving compute resources elsewhere.
- **SPH (Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics)**: A particle-based method for simulating fluids. Instead of a fixed grid, moving particles carry fluid properties and interact through smoothing kernels.
- **Resolution**: The smallest spatial or mass scale a simulation can resolve. Higher resolution yields more detail but at significantly greater computational cost.
- **Initial Conditions (IC)**: The starting state of the simulation — positions, velocities, densities, etc. Incorrect ICs will invalidate results regardless of code quality.
