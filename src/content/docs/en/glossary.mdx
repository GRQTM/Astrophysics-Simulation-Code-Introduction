# Core simulation glossary

Use one preferred translation per source term to keep multilingual pages consistent.

## Terms

- **Hydrodynamics**: numerical treatment of fluid motion, shocks, and mixing.
- **N-body**: time evolution of many gravitationally interacting particles.
- **AMR (Adaptive Mesh Refinement)**: selective local grid refinement.
- **SPH (Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics)**: particle-based fluid model using kernel-weighted neighbors.
- **Resolution**: smallest scale represented numerically.
- **Initial conditions**: starting state that strongly constrains later outcomes.

## Policy

- English term is the source-of-truth key.
- Korean and future locales map translations to that same key.
