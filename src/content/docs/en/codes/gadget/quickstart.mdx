## Target outcome

- Compile a runnable GADGET executable.
- Execute a small hydro or gravity example.
- Check output integrity and runtime stability.

## Installation

1. Prepare compiler + MPI + FFTW/HDF5 stack per official instructions.
2. Download/extract the GADGET source package allowed for your use case.
3. Configure build options (`Config.sh` or equivalent) for a minimal test.
4. Build with parallel make.

## Example run used here

```bash
cd <gadget-root>
cp examples/<test-case>/Config.sh ./Config.sh
make -j8
mpirun -np 4 ./Gadget4 examples/<test-case>/param.txt
```

## Validate quickly

- Ensure the run exits normally and writes expected snapshots.
- Check log-reported conserved quantities for obvious drift.
- Plot one diagnostic profile to confirm non-pathological behavior.
