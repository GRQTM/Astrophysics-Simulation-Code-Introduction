## 1. Freeze binary and parameters

- Finalize compile flags and the runtime parameter file.
- Archive source revision, toolchain versions, and compile logs.
- Build once and reuse the same binary across the entire campaign.

## 2. Stage filesystem and launch script

```bash
mkdir -p /scratch/<project>/gadget-prod/{ic,output,logs,restart}
cp <ic-files> /scratch/<project>/gadget-prod/ic/
```

```bash
#!/bin/bash
#SBATCH -J gadget_prod
#SBATCH -N 8
#SBATCH --ntasks-per-node=64
#SBATCH -t 24:00:00
#SBATCH -o logs/slurm-%j.out

cd /scratch/<project>/gadget-prod
srun /path/to/Gadget4 params_prod.txt
```

## 3. Runtime monitoring

- Track the timestep floor, load balance, and remaining memory headroom.
- Verify that checkpoints are being produced and are restartable.
- Keep run metadata in the same directory tree as outputs.

## 4. Quality checks

- Compare global statistics with pilot and baseline runs.
- Validate key observables against expected physical trends.
- Archive scripts and environment manifests alongside final data.
