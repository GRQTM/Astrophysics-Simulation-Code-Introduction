## Use-case framing

- Specify whether the run is collisionless, hydro, or fully coupled.
- List primary scientific metrics and required output products.
- Translate target scales into particle counts and softening lengths.

## Numerical setup

- Choose gravity and time-integration tolerances for target accuracy.
- Set SPH-related parameters with at least one sensitivity test.
- Include a small-box pilot for throughput and stability checks.

## Data and analysis plan

- Define snapshot cadence from expected dynamical timescales.
- Store lightweight monitoring channels for frequent QA.
- Reserve space for restarts and metadata artifacts.
