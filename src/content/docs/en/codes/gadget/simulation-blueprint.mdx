## Define the use case

- Decide whether the run is collisionless, hydro, or fully coupled.
- List the primary scientific metrics and required output products.
- Translate target physical scales into particle counts and softening lengths.

## Numerical setup

- Choose gravity and time-integration tolerances for your target accuracy.
- Set SPH-related parameters and run at least one sensitivity test.
- Include a small-box pilot to check throughput and stability.

## Data and analysis plan

- Set snapshot cadence based on expected dynamical timescales.
- Keep lightweight monitoring channels running at higher frequency for QA.
- Reserve storage for restart files and total expected data volume.
