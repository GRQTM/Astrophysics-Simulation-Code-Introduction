## Scientific scope

- Declare target observables and acceptable error margins.
- Decide whether MFM or MFV is the primary hydro mode.
- Define mandatory diagnostics before launch.

## Model assembly

- Start from gravity + hydro baseline.
- Add cooling, star formation, feedback, or MHD incrementally.
- Record each configuration in a run registry.

## Resolution and cadence

- Set particle mass and softening from physical objectives.
- Schedule snapshots by dynamical timescale.
- Keep high-frequency lightweight diagnostics for QA.

## Pre-flight checks

- Complete a short convergence-oriented pilot.
- Validate restart behavior and output compatibility.
- Estimate full campaign walltime and storage footprint.
