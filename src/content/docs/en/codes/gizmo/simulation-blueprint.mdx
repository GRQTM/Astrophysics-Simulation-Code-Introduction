## Scientific scope

- Declare target observables and acceptable error margins.
- Decide whether MFM or MFV will be the primary hydro mode.
- Define the diagnostics you must monitor before launch.

## Model assembly

- Start from a gravity + hydro baseline.
- Add cooling, star formation, feedback, or MHD one module at a time.
- Record each configuration in a run registry for reproducibility.

## Resolution and output cadence

- Set particle mass and softening length based on your physical objectives.
- Schedule snapshot outputs by dynamical timescale.
- Keep high-frequency lightweight diagnostics running separately for QA.

## Pre-flight checks

- Complete a short convergence-oriented pilot run.
- Validate restart behavior and output format compatibility.
- Estimate full campaign walltime and storage needs.
