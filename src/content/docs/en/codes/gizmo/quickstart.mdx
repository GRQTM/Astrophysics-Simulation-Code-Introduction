## Target outcome

- Build a functional GIZMO executable.
- Run one bundled hydro example in MFM/MFV mode.
- Confirm stable completion and valid outputs.

## Installation

1. Install compiler, MPI, and math/I/O dependencies required by your build mode.
2. Clone the public source and inspect build documentation.
3. Select a minimal `Config.sh` for a first hydro test.
4. Compile and verify executable creation.

## Example run used here

```bash
git clone https://github.com/pfhopkins/gizmo-public.git
cd gizmo-public
cp <example-config> ./Config.sh
make -j8
mpirun -np 4 ./GIZMO <example-parameter-file>
```

## Validate quickly

- Confirm run log progression without instability flags.
- Check generated snapshots/diagnostics are readable.
- Compare one profile with known test-case behavior.
