## Target outcome

- Build an AREPO executable in your local environment.
- Run a 1D hydro sanity case (`wave_1d`).
- Confirm that outputs are generated without runtime errors.

## Installation

1. Prepare a Linux or macOS environment with C/C++ compiler, `make`, and MPI.
2. Install required scientific libraries for your chosen setup (commonly FFTW, GSL, HDF5).
3. Obtain the AREPO source from your licensed/authorized repository.
4. Confirm toolchain paths in your local build configuration files.

## Example run used here

```bash
cd <arepo-root>
cp examples/wave_1d/Config.sh ./Config.sh
cp examples/wave_1d/param.txt ./param_wave_1d.txt
make -j8
mpirun -np 4 ./Arepo param_wave_1d.txt
```

## Validate quickly

- Check the run log for successful timestep advancement.
- Confirm output snapshot files were written.
- Plot one primitive variable (e.g., density) to verify a physically smooth profile.

Use [Production Run](/en/codes/arepo/production-run/) when moving from this smoke test to a full project workflow.
