## Problem definition

- Write a one-sentence scientific objective.
- Define measurable diagnostics tied to that objective.
- Set success criteria before spending compute budget.

## Physics and modules

- Start from minimal gravity + hydro.
- Add modules (cooling, MHD, RT, feedback) one at a time.
- Track each module change in a run manifest.

## Domain and resolution

- Choose box/domain size from target physical scales.
- Set mass/spatial resolution based on required observables.
- Plan at least one lower-resolution pilot for convergence checks.

## Initial conditions and outputs

- Version initial condition files and generation scripts.
- Define snapshot cadence and lightweight diagnostic cadence separately.
- Reserve enough storage for snapshots + logs + restart files.

## Pre-production checklist

- Parameters reviewed by at least one collaborator.
- Test run completed and restart tested.
- Walltime and node count estimated from pilot profiling.
