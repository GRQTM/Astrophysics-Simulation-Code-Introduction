## Define your scientific question

- State a single, clear scientific objective for this simulation.
- Identify 2–3 quantitative diagnostics that will tell you whether the objective is met.
- Set explicit success criteria before allocating compute resources.

## Choose physics and modules

- Start with a minimal configuration — gravity + hydrodynamics only.
- Add additional modules (cooling, MHD, RT, feedback) one at a time.
- Record every module change in a run manifest so each configuration is reproducible.

## Set up domain and resolution

- Size the simulation box to match the physical scales you care about.
- Choose mass and spatial resolutions based on what you need to measure.
- Run at least one lower-resolution pilot to check numerical convergence.

## Prepare initial conditions and outputs

- Version-control your IC generation scripts and the resulting IC files.
- Configure heavy snapshots and lightweight diagnostics on separate output schedules.
- Make sure you have enough storage allocated for snapshots, logs, and restart files.

## Pre-production checklist

- Have a colleague review all runtime parameters.
- Verify that a test run completes and restarts cleanly.
- Estimate walltime and node requirements from pilot profiling data.
