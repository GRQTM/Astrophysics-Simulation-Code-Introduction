## Science and diagnostics

- Define one primary question and 2-3 quantitative diagnostics.
- Specify which outputs are needed to compute those diagnostics.
- Set acceptable numerical error levels in advance.

## AMR strategy

- Choose refinement triggers (density, Jeans length, shocks, etc.).
- Set max refinement level from target spatial scale.
- Test refinement sensitivity with a short parameter sweep.

## Physical model scope

- Start with hydro-only baseline.
- Add gravity, cooling, chemistry, or feedback incrementally.
- Keep a changelog mapping each module toggle to run IDs.

## Output and storage plan

- Separate high-frequency diagnostics from heavy checkpoints.
- Predict total file count and per-dump size.
- Reserve archive space for restart and provenance files.
