## Scientific objectives and diagnostics

- Formulate a primary research question with 2–3 quantitative diagnostics.
- Identify the specific outputs needed to compute those diagnostics.
- Set acceptable numerical error tolerances before running.

## AMR strategy

- Define refinement triggers (e.g., density gradients, Jeans length, shocks).
- Calculate the maximum refinement level from your target spatial resolution.
- Run a brief parameter sweep to evaluate refinement sensitivity.

## Physical model scope

- Start with a hydrodynamics-only baseline.
- Add gravity, cooling, chemistry, or feedback modules one at a time.
- Keep a changelog that maps each module addition to a specific run ID.

## Output and storage management

- Separate high-frequency lightweight diagnostics from heavy snapshot checkpoints.
- Estimate total file count and disk footprint per output.
- Allocate archival storage for restart files and data provenance records.
