## Target outcome

- Build a working Enzo executable.
- Run the 1D Sod shock-tube example.
- Confirm outputs and basic AMR behavior.

## Installation

1. Clone `enzo-dev` and review the official build prerequisites.
2. Install compiler/MPI/HDF5 toolchain required by your platform.
3. Build Enzo following the documentation for your machine profile.
4. Locate the final Enzo binary path for test execution.

## Example run used here

```bash
git clone https://github.com/enzo-project/enzo-dev.git
cd enzo-dev/run/Hydro/Hydro-1D/SodShockTube
# generate/confirm inputs as documented for this example
mpirun -np 4 <path-to-enzo-binary> <sod-parameter-file>
```

## Validate quickly

- Verify the run reaches completion without AMR crashes.
- Inspect output dumps for shock/contact structure.
- Compare against reference profile from the example notes.

Move to [Production Run](/en/codes/enzo/production-run/) once this pipeline is reproducible.
