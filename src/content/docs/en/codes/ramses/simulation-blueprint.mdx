## Science-first planning

- Define physical scales that drive AMR requirements.
- Map desired observables to specific outputs/diagnostics.
- Set acceptable numerical tolerances for each observable.

## AMR and module strategy

- Choose refinement criteria aligned with the science goal.
- Set refinement caps from memory and walltime constraints.
- Add advanced modules (RT/MHD/etc.) after baseline validation.

## IC and output policy

- Version-control IC generation and metadata.
- Separate heavy snapshots from frequent lightweight diagnostics.
- Plan restart cadence for long walltime campaigns.

## Readiness checklist

- Pilot run completed and analyzed.
- Restart tested under scheduler conditions.
- Storage and archival plan approved before production.
