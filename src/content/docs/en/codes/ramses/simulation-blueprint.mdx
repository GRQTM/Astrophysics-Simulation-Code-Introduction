## Science-first planning

- Define the physical scales that drive your AMR requirements.
- Map desired observables to specific outputs and diagnostics.
- Set acceptable numerical tolerances for each observable.

## AMR and module strategy

- Choose refinement criteria aligned with your science goal.
- Set refinement caps based on memory and walltime constraints.
- Add advanced modules (RT, MHD, etc.) only after baseline validation.

## IC and output policy

- Version-control IC generation scripts and metadata.
- Separate heavy snapshots from frequent lightweight diagnostics.
- Plan restart cadence for long walltime campaigns.

## Readiness checklist

- Pilot run completed and analyzed.
- Restart tested under scheduler conditions.
- Storage and archival plan confirmed before production.
