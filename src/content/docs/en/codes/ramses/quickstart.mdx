## Target outcome

- Build a RAMSES executable.
- Run one small AMR hydro validation case.
- Confirm expected output files and stable execution.

## Installation

1. Clone the official RAMSES repository.
2. Install compiler + MPI + HDF5 environment for your platform.
3. Follow the current user-guide build path for your branch/release.
4. Keep a minimal first-run configuration before enabling extra modules.

## Example run used here

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ramses-organisation/ramses.git
cd ramses
cmake -S . -B build -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release
cmake --build build -j8
mpirun -np 4 <path-to-ramses-binary> <input-namelist>
```

## Validate quickly

- Check AMR level evolution for the expected test behavior.
- Confirm snapshots/checkpoints are written as planned.
- Compare one profile with reference curves from documentation.
